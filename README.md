* PoseNet is a machine learning model that allows for Real-time Human Pose Estimation.  
* PoseNet can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.
